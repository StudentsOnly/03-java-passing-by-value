## Exercise: Swapping Two Numbers

### Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to practice creating a program that swaps the values of two integer variables using a method that employs pass by value. This exercise will help you understand the concept of pass by value and how it differs from pass by reference.

### Instructions:
#### Prompt for Input:
- Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integer values.
- Store these values in two separate integer variables.

#### Create a Swap Method:
- Implement a method named swap that takes two integer parameters.
- Inside this method, swap the values of the parameters. Note that this method should only modify the copies of the parameters and not the original variables passed by the user.
- This method should not return any values.

#### Display the Swapped Values:
- After calling the swap method, display the original values to show that they have not been changed.
- Also, display the swapped values as they were modified within the method.

#### Run the Program:
- Run the program and verify the output.
